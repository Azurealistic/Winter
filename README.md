Advent of Code. Solutions in various languages.

Including but not limited to:
- Python 3
- Ruby
- Rust
- C++20

The goal is to become proficient with this languages and solving problems such as these is a decent way to do it in my book. Initially everything will be solved in Python but I will add other languages as I become more familiar with them. Goal is to have code for each language when finished.
